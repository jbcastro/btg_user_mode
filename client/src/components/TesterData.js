      "Didier Dagueneau was a fourth generation winemaker in the village of St Andelain in Pouilly-Fumé. As someone who always liked to push the limits, Didier left his home town at a young age to race motorcycle side cars on the international circuit between 1978 and 1982. He later added dog-sled racing to his list of passions, and here too, competed internationally for many years during the winter months. Dagueneau returned to the his native village in 1982 and in typical Didier fashion, elected to set up his own estate in Pouilly-Fumé rather than join the family fold. Inspired by the great wines of Burgundy and other top regions (his mentors were Edmond Vatan and Henri Jayer) and emboldened by the wisdom and traditions of his grandfather, Louis Dagueneau, he set about to create a Pouilly-Fumé of extraordinary dimension and terroir focus exploiting the top vineyard sites around St. Andelain. He acquired his first parcel, 1.2 hectares of En Chailloux, and began to vinify under his own label in the 1982 vintage. In 1985, he added the now infamous Silex, and in 1988, Pur Sang.",

After their death, the vineyards were divided between their 4 children.

In 1987 Domaine du Pegau was formed as we know it today, when Laurence Feraud returned from her winemaking studies and she teamed up with her father Paul to create the winery.

He brought in Michel Rolland as the consultant and they set out to make wine that challenged the best estates of Pomerol. They increased the amount of new, French oak barrels the wine was aging in, as well as increasing the time the wine spent in oak. Chateau Clinet is situated on great terroir.

He was the youngest of the centuries-old Champagne house. Like generations of fathers and sons before, it was in his blood to be a wine grower and creator—a true vigneron. “It’s a title you're born with, not something you become or learn in school, An unexpected internship at a winery brought Christophe to the Walla Walla Valley for the first time in 1993. After one year, he traveled the world gaining experience in Australia, New Zealand, Romania and Oregon. He intended to buy some land and start a vineyard from scratch, but all those plans came to an abrupt halt on an April morning in 1996. Christophe had returned to Walla Walla for a strictly social visit, and was wandering the countryside with a friend. As they drove near the Oregon/Washington border, he spied an open field littered with acres of softball-sized stones. Plans to move to the Willamette Valley were quickly discarded, and Christophe resolved to buy the property and plant a vineyard. He saw something different with enormous potential. The terroir reminded him of the cobblestones of the southern Rhone valley and Châteuneuf-du-Pape in his native France. “I almost fell on my derrière when I saw those stones,” he says. “And I've been living the dream ever since.” ",

After centuries of family ownership, Yquem was finally sold in acrimonious circumstances to Louis Vuitton-Moët-Hennessy in 1999. However, its former owner and director Alexandre de Lur-Saluce remains in charge. Yquem is located on the highest hill in Sauternes and enjoys the best growing conditions in the whole appellation. The 110-hectare vineyard is planted with 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc. Only fully botrytized fruit is picked by the 150 highly skilled pickers and yields are so low that each vine produces only one glass of wine. Yquem is fermented in oak barrels (100% new) and is left in barriques to mature for up to 36 months. Intensely opulent when young, Yquem develops an extraordinary complexity and exotic richness when fully mature, with the best vintages lasting for over 50 years. Château d'Yquem is classified as a 1er Cru Classé supérieur.",

Daniel is a bit of a Renaissance man. His enthusiasm and passion for learning extends beyond wine and into music; he is a gifted guitarist and accordion player. A visit to his website illustrates the symmetry between his music and his wines. Sauvignon Blanc is more than a grape variety; it is a tempo as well. Daniel and his son Simon farm the slopes of the village Crezancy-en-Sancerre, where flint meets clay and the famous Kimmeridgian limestone. He practices sustainable farming, and uses organic composts to treat the vines. Typically, he harvests his grapes later than his neighbors which results in less of the acidity that is so typical of the appellation. Aging the wine on its lees further rounds the mid-palate. Like his jazz, Daniel’s wines are luscious and complex with deep notes and long, satisfying finales.",

      "Krug was founded in 1843 by Johann-Joseph Krug, a German immigrant from Mainz on the Rhine who learned his trade at Champagne Jacquesson for nine years before setting up his own Champagne house in Reims. Krug remained in the family’s hands for several generations, with continual father-to-son handovers until 1999 when it was bought by the global luxury brands conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH). Like most of the companies in the group, Krug retains a degree of autonomy and the house is still headed by Krug family member Olivier Krug, the sixth generation of Krug, who is insistent upon maintaining the house’s reputation and consistent style. All the wines at Krug undergo primary fermentation in small 205-litre oak barrels from the Forest of Argonne and Central France. The barrels are all well-seasoned and organoleptically inert. Each cru is vinified separately, with no malolactic fermentation, and the two rackings are done by gravity. Krug Grande Cuvee is born from the dream of one man, Joseph Krug, to offer the very best Champagne every single year, regardless of annual variations in climate. Every year since 1843, the House of Krug has honored this dream with a new Edition of Krug Grande Cuvee: the fullest expression of Champagne. Its exceptional finesse is the result of a stay of around seven years in the cellars. The 166the edition is composed of 140 wines from 13 different harvests between 1998 and 2010. This wine is 58% from the base year of 2010, but fully 42% of the cuvée is composed of reserve wines, with disgorgement done in the winter of 2017. Uniquely, the House of Krug pairs each cuvee to music, and they selected Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto to go with this wine.",

Lauer still ferments each of the six vineyard sites that are now part of Ayler Kupp separately so each barrel gets a number that corresponds to a parcel. These vineyards range from warm, south-facing sites near the river all the way up the hill to the cold & windy hilltop, contributing a huge range of flavors and structural components to the wines. Florian is a minimalist in their cellar in the village of Ayl. The only interventions are temperature control and a clarification prior to fermentation and battonage. Spontaneous fermentation and lees contact are the norm here.

Schloss Gobelsburg maintains a large number of parcels in Erste Lagen, or 1st Growth, vineyards in the Kamptal, including the deep loess soils of Renner, Grub, and Lamm planted to Grüner Veltliner.

In the mid-20th century, the family decided to completely stop making wine in wooden barrels, preferring to create clean, pure, and precise Chablis without adding artificial woody flavors. Through this philosophy, combined with the limited yields inspired by organic wine-growing techniques, the domaine has developed a worldwide reputation for fine winemaking in stainless steel tanks. They don't add yeast, and all the wines go through a natural malolactic fermentation. A firmly-rooted sense of excellence is passed down from generation to generation.

With the help of his wife, Stéphanie, Bruno farms eight hectares of land, in thirty different parcels scattered over five communes, with sometimes as little as just a few rows per parcel. To farm under these circumstances is quintessentially Burgundian, where the old Napoleonic codes of inheritance (evolved from Roman law) divide property equally among offspring.  In the old family winery in the center of the village of Chassagne-Montrachet, he vinifies nineteen cuvées separately, twelve of which are premier cru! He uses traditional vinification methods and ages his wines anywhere from twelve to eighteen months in barrel, though he tends to vinify each parcel in a similar fashion. Bruno’s style shows beautiful balance, both aromatically and texturally, while showcasing the delicate minerality and nuanced complexity of each vineyard. His holdings in Chenevottes were planted in 1979 and the wine is aged in 20-25% new French oak. ",

      "Vincent Girardin was born into a family history with a long standing passion for wine. The history of Maison Vincent Girardin is relatively recent. In 1980, at the age of 19, Vincent Girardin, the son of a family of winegrowers based in Santenay since the 17th century, decided to strike out on his own, and began producing wine from two hectares of vines that he had inherited from his parents. From his earliest youth Vincent had a passion for working with vines, and great respect for the potential that they represent and was always ambitious to produce his own wine. The quality of his wines was quickly recognized by connoisseurs all over the world, and this enabled him to expand his activity, focusing primarily on the great white and red wines of the Côte de Beaune. In the years between 1980 and 1990 his passion and curiosity led him to try all of the techniques that were being employed at that time. It was only in the early 2000s with the arrival of Eric Germain as winemaker, that a profound change began to take place. They decided to concentrate on the essence of the wines: the expression of the great terroirs of Burgundy. A new purity of style was born, which has now been acknowledged by all winemakers. The Cuvee Saint-Vincent comes mostly from 45 year old vines around the Cote de Beaune. It is aged in 500L barrels (10% new)  for 10 months and blended only on fruit days according to the biodynamic calendar. ",

      "With it’s first recorded mention in 1063, Chateau de Breze sits on the outskirts of the small village of Breze, in the Saumur region of the Loire Valley.  At first a medieval castle, that ancient building was mostly razed in the late 1500’s to start the construction of the chateau that exists today. Other than World War II, when the Germans occupied the country and Chateau de Breze, the Breze family has owned, and continues to own, the chateau. The château is not only a UNESCO World Heritage site, but the wines were regularly exchanged by the royals for Sauternes’ greatest, Château d’Yquem. When the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) of Saumur-Champigny was established in 1957, the owner of Château de Brézé refused the inclusion of his vineyards into this red wine appellation. His claim was that his historical vineyards were the best in the area and that they should have their own AOC, Brézé.  He was denied and the vineyards became part of Saumur. In 2009, the château’s new owner, le Comte de Colbert, asked Yves Lambert and his son, Arnaud to control the winery. They accepted and immediately began converting these historical vineyards to organic after more than fifty years of chemical farming. Today, after many years of quality farming and the deft touch of Arnaud, the brilliance of the wines known centuries ago is reemerging.",

He sources grapes from some of the best vineyards in the Pacific Northwest: Les Collines, Destiny Ridge, Stoney Vine, Boushey, and his newest acquisition of Pinot Noir from Seven Springs Vineyard in Eola-Amity hills in Oregon. With an emphasis on Syrah and Rhone varietals, W.T. is also known for serious Gruner Veltliner from Underwood Mountain in Washington's Columbia Gorge.

The wine first goes through a primary fermentation in cuve, but is then bottled before all of the residual sugar has converted to alcohol.

      'Alois Kracher was born in 1959 and passed in 2007. "Luis"was one of the great visionaries of viticulture, the spearhead of the "Austrian wine miracle"of the 1990s and the motor of the worldwide renaissance of sweet wines. The entire wine world mourned the "Luis"after his untimely death. He was a skilled chemist and joined his father\'s winery at the age of 22 and subsequently created a new dessert wine style, in which fruit, finesse and balance are more important than mere sweetness. With the 1991 vintage, Alois Kracher caused a sensation internationally for the first time. Soon his name became synonymous with cult sweet wines, especially in America. Since 2007, Gerhard Kracher manages the winery that his grandfather built and made his father world famous.',

      'The history of Madeira wine stretches back to the Age of Exploration, when Madeira was a frequent port of call for ships whose captains would fuel up on wine—fortified to prevent spoilage—for their trans-Atlantic journey. The blazing heat of the sea voyage transformed the flavor of the wines, a metamorphosis reproduced by a process called estufagem during which the wines are heated to as high as 140°F and oxidated. Founded in 1996, Broadbent Madeira was inspired by Bartholomew Broadbent’s father, Michael Broadbent, who called Madeira his “desert island wine,” and who played a crucial role along with his wife, Daphne, in sourcing the wines and establishing the blends. By definition, Malmsey is the sweetest style of Madeira. Composed of Malvasia, from which the very British "Malmsey"nickname is derived. Michael Broadbent, one of the most famous tasters alive today, is responsible for blending this wine, and clearly he is someone who prefers a jolt of acidity in his madeiras, even the typically unctuous, sweet Malmsey.',

Blandy’s 1792 is an outstanding example of this. Chris Blandy, the family’s 7th generation member to work in the company states, “Whilst the family’s cellars were fortunate enough to have benefited from the foresight of my ancestor Charles Ridpath, our focus today continues to be on aging and producing these fine vintage Madeiras.” The exceptional 1985 Malmsey (bottled in 2009) is a case in point, in 2010 having won the Madeira Trophy at the International Wine Challenge and the Fortified Wine Trophy at the International Wine and Spirit competition.”",

Jérome, the sole son, did not originally intend to join the family business, becoming instead a professional trumpeter, in the Republican Guard. In 2004 he left Paris and the army and came back to Morey-St Denis to make wine. Charmes-Chambertin is a 78-acre Grand Cru vineyard in Gevrey-Chambertin. Charmes-Chambertin is the largest of the Gevrey-Chambertin Grand Crus, and it generally has an excellent reputation. The slope of the vineyard is gentle and the surface soil poor. Castagnier farms following biodynamic principles, although he is not certified. He never uses herbicides or pesticides and plows the soil. He likes to work with ample ripeness and will wait until the perfect moment to harvest. ",

A proud and uncompromising pioneer of fine winemaking in the Northern Rhône, his Syrahs from the cru of Cornas have earned their place among the most celebrated wines of France. The Clapes have been vignerons for many generations, but the infamous grower strikes of 1906 and 1907 forced Auguste's grandfather out of the Languedoc and into the Northern Rhône to start anew from practically nothing. The Clapes rebuilt their fortunes, terrace by terrace, along the steep, western slopes of the Rhône River. For many years, the majority of growers in Cornas sold their fruit to négociants. Auguste was the first to bottle his own wine, which eventually paved the way for such contemporary superstars as Thierry Allemand. Without pretense or fanfare, Auguste, the former mayor of Cornas, was a stately picture of grace and magnanimity—a no-nonsense wise man who never rested on his laurels and sought to better himself and his wines each year until his passing in 2018 at the age of 93. Today, his son, Pierre-Marie, and grandson, Olivier, carry on his legacy with honor and integrity. This wine is selection of the domaine’s oldest vines and is aged 22 months in large foudres and was not destemmed. ",

Mark Kirwan was also responsible for the building the chateau that is in use today. Chateau Kirwan was one of the few Medoc properties that Thomas Jefferson, the Ambassador to France and future third President of the United States visited on his Bordeaux wine tasting trip. We know this based on the personal records and diaries of Thomas Jefferson, written in 1780. After a long period when Chateau Kirwan was not known for producing the quality of wine the Left Bank estate was able to produce, the management hired Michel Rolland to consult the estate starting in 1991. Michel Rolland was replaced in 2006 at Chateau Kirwan. Jean Henri Schyler was in charge of managing the chateau until he passed away, November, 2016 at the age of 85.

These factors – dry conditions without drought, an exceptional amount of sunshine, cool nights and rainfall that arrived at just the right time – give the 2010 vintage a remarkable identity.

In 2013, Erica decided the time had come to create a wine all her own. The grenache vines at Stillwater Creek vineyard in Royal City, Washington were planted in 2004 and are south facing and steeply sloped, the soils are rocky decomposed basalt. The grenache was hand-picked and destemmed. Rustic and approachable, this hand-picked Grenache was fermented with a touch of Mourvèdre and Syrah and aged in mature French oak. ",

He was replaced by Carel Voorhuis who was the winemaker at Domaine d’Ardhuy.  The wines are 100% de-stemmed and aged for 12 months in barrel.",

Jean-Marc has instituted several changes at the estate, the most prominent of which is the construction of a new cave. Of equal importance, Jean-Marc expanded the amount of vineyards under cultivation and has made subtle modifications in vinification and elevage to place his own “mark” on this estate which now covers approximately fifteen hectares with an annual production of, more or less, 60,000 bottles. Chassagne-Montrachet Clos St Jean has been recognised as a privileged vineyard for at least a thousand years – various religious institutions have claimed it as their own over the centuries.",

      "At the foot of the rolling vineyards of Moulin-à-Vent, just across the road from its famous namesake windmill, Domaine Diochon has been making Beaujolais the old-fashioned way since 1935.  Bernard Diochon succeeded his father in 1967. According to Bernard, one of the most unique qualities of the domaine is the quality of the soil that they farm. Crumbly granite allows the vines to plunge easily towards “gore” subsoil, which feeds the vines, while adding a pronounced mineral component to the wine. In 2007, Bernard wanted to retire but had no heirs. He appointed Thomas Patenôtre as his heir apparent, which has turned out to be an easy transition. This wine comes from 100 year old vines, and is fermented in whole clusters. ",

      "Château Rieussec has long been considered a great wine of the world and can compete, in netter vintages, with Chateau Y'quem. For the 1855 classification, M. Mayne was the owner of the estate. The quality of the Rieussec soil earned its ranking as a first growth Sauternes and Barsac. This is Rieussec’s second wine, but is selected according to the same standards as the first wine. Its character consistently reveals a beautiful aromatic range dominated by citrus flavours. Carmes de Rieussec’s name is a reference to the Carmelite monks in Langon, who owned the Rieussec estate in the 18th century. In 1984, Rieussec was bought by Domaines Barons de Rothschild, the owners of Château Lafite Rothschild. The Rothschilds invested in a new cellar in 1989, and strove to increase quality by better selection of the grapes, which also led to reduced production in the 1990s. In the 1993 vintage, one of three difficult Bordeaux vintages in a row, no Château Rieussec grand vin was produced at all out of quality considerations. One of the more recent recognitions for quality was when Château Rieussec 2001 was selected as Wine Spectator's Wine of the Year in 2004",

      "The historic Fritz Haag wine estate is located in the heart of the central Mosel River Valley. The earliest documentation of the estate dates back to 1605. At that time, the village in which it is situated was known as “Dusemond.” In 1925, this village was renamed “Brauneberg” (“brown mountain,” a reference to the color of the slate soil in this area of the Mosel) in an endeavour to further promote the reputation of its world-renowned vineyards “Brauneberger Juffer” and “Brauneberger Juffer Sonnenuhr.” The name “Juffer,” which translates as “old maid” in the local dialect, goes back to 1790. The vineyards are recognised as true pearls of the Mosel region and were treasured even by Napoleon. The Goldkapsel denotes a wine considered better by the producer. It usually means a Prädikatswein that is sweeter or more intense, and wine made in a very small lot.",

      "In the world of wine, there are many good winegrowers however, Auguste Clape will go down in history as one of the greats. A proud and uncompromising pioneer of fine winemaking in the Northern Rhône, his Syrahs from the cru of Cornas have earned their place among the most celebrated wines of France. The Clapes have been vignerons for many generations, but the infamous grower strikes of 1906 and 1907 forced Auguste's grandfather out of the Languedoc and into the Northern Rhône to start anew from practically nothing. The Clapes rebuilt their fortunes, terrace by terrace, along the steep, western slopes of the Rhône River. For many years, the majority of growers in Cornas sold their fruit to négociants. Auguste was the first to bottle his own wine, which eventually paved the way for such contemporary superstars as Thierry Allemand. Without pretense or fanfare, Auguste, the former mayor of Cornas, was a stately picture of grace and magnanimity—a no-nonsense wise man who never rested on his laurels and sought to better himself and his wines each year until his passing in 2018 at the age of 93. Today, his son, Pierre-Marie, and grandson, Olivier, carry on his legacy with honor and integrity. Since 1998, a second Cornas has also been bottled: Renaissance. It’s made from 20 to 25-year-old vines on the domaine’s best slopes as well as older vines from the lower slopes.",

      "The first evidence of Château de Beaucastel as it exists today is in the sixteenth century. In 1549, Pierre de Beaucastel bought a “barn with a plot of land extending to 52 saumées at Coudoulet.” The manor house was then built with the arms of Beaucastel sculpted on a stone wall of the drawing room. In 1687, de Beaucastel was appointed “Capitaine de la ville de Courthezon” by Louis XIV in recognition of his conversion to Catholicism. Louis XIV’s letter, also signed by Colbert, is still visible at the Château. In 1909, Pierre Traminer bought the estate and then transferred it to his son-in-law Pierre Perrin, a scientist who further developed Beaucastel. His son, Jacques, continued his father’s efforts until 1978 and gave its noble letters to the wine. Today, the torch is being carried by Jean-Pierre and François, Jacques’ sons. Marc, Pierre, Thomas, Cécile, Charles, Matthieu, and César, the fifth generation, work with them today. Beaucastel is, first of all, a family story, the story of Famille Perrin. Beaucastel was one of the very first domaines to practise organic viticulture - namely no use of herbicides, insecticides or any other chemicals. Unusually, all 13 permitted grape varieties are grown although it is Mourvèdre which is Beaucastel`s signature grape, often making up a third of the final blend.",
