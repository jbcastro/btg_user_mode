Passionate about music, he worked for 10 years in the organization of concerts and as DJ in the discotheques. At thirty he returned to the land to perpetuate the work of his grandparents and his father Michel who was one of the first to believe in the supremacy of Chardonnay in Chitry. Chitry is as close as you can get to Chablis and the soils here are the same kimmeridgian chalky series which is shown in the flinty minerality of the wines. Olivier Morin invested in a semi-underground winery, which allows working by gravity, reducing the pumping and crushing wine. The wine is made as naturally as possible without input: spontaneous fermentation carried out by indigenous yeasts exacerbates the complexity and typicality of Chitry , no correction of acid, a bottling with little or no filtration, sulfur Homeopathic dose.",

      "Krug was founded in 1843 by Johann-Joseph Krug, a German immigrant from Mainz on the Rhine who learned his trade at Champagne Jacquesson for nine years before setting up his own Champagne house in Reims. Krug remained in the family’s hands for several generations, with continual father-to-son handovers until 1999 when it was bought by the global luxury brands conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH). Like most of the companies in the group, Krug retains a degree of autonomy and the house is still headed by Krug family member Olivier Krug, the sixth generation of Krug, who is insistent upon maintaining the house’s reputation and consistent style. All the wines at Krug undergo primary fermentation in small 205-litre oak barrels from the Forest of Argonne and Central France. The barrels are all well-seasoned and organoleptically inert. Each cru is vinified separately, with no malolactic fermentation, and the two rackings are done by gravity. Krug Grande Cuvee is born from the dream of one man, Joseph Krug, to offer the very best Champagne every single year, regardless of annual variations in climate. Every year since 1843, the House of Krug has honored this dream with a new Edition of Krug Grande Cuvee: the fullest expression of Champagne. Its exceptional finesse is the result of a stay of around seven years in the cellars. The 166the edition is composed of 140 wines from 13 different harvests between 1998 and 2010. This wine is 58% from the base year of 2010, but fully 42% of the cuvée is composed of reserve wines, with disgorgement done in the winter of 2017. Uniquely, the House of Krug pairs each cuvee to music, and they selected Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto to go with this wine.",

Prior to the legal consolidation of vineyard names in 1971, there were many vineyard sites comparable to the "lieux-dits" of Burgundy. Lauer still ferments each of the six vineyard sites that are now part of Ayler Kupp separately so each barrel gets a number that corresponds to a parcel. These vineyards range from warm, south-facing sites near the river all the way up the hill to the cold & windy hilltop, contributing a huge range of flavors and structural components to the wines. Florian is a minimalist in their cellar in the village of Ayl. The only interventions are temperature control and a clarification prior to fermentation and battonage. Spontaneous fermentation and lees contact are the norm here. The Barrel X is a playful exception to the single site rule - a blend of parcels within the Saar from Ayler Kupp and a few parcels farmed by friends. ',

To farm under these circumstances is quintessentially Burgundian, where the old Napoleonic codes of inheritance (evolved from Roman law) divide property equally among offspring.  In the old family winery in the center of the village of Chassagne-Montrachet, he vinifies nineteen cuvées separately, twelve of which are premier cru! He uses traditional vinification methods and ages his wines anywhere from twelve to eighteen months in barrel, though he tends to vinify each parcel in a similar fashion. Bruno’s style shows beautiful balance, both aromatically and texturally, while showcasing the delicate minerality and nuanced complexity of each vineyard.

He already had twenty years of experience behind him. After studies at Beaune's Lycée Viticole and work-experience in St-Emilion in the Bordeaux region, Vincent rejoined the family domaine in 1986. In the same year Sophie was vinifying her first vintage for the Ménager-Belland domaine in Santenay. This wine was aged 100% in barrel of which 40% is new wood. 2009 was a warmer growing year and is still generous 10 years down the road. La Truffiere was, until recently, a scrubby, forested patch on the hill and an abundant source of truffles, the black fungi that were among the favorite delicacies of the Burgundian nobility. This has given the climat its name, although the truffles have been replaced in the past 50 years bygrapes",

His sons, Alphonse and Henri, succeeded him after the conclusion of World War I, increasing the domaine’s holdings significantly and beginning to bottle their own wines. Henri’s son Paul then took over the domaine in 1968, and acquired the prestigious Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru vineyards. Today, the domaine owns 13 hectares of vines (4.5 in red) and is run by Paul’s dynamic son Thierry who began working in 1999, before taking over full time in 2004. Thierry is the 4th generation to take on the reins of this storied property.   Under Thierry the focus has been put squarely in the vineyards, with a discreet use of new wood and a non-interventionist approach in the cellar.  The result is wines of finesse and palate staining purity that perfectly reflect the finest terroirs of Chassagne-Montrachet.",

In 1980, at the age of 19, Vincent Girardin, the son of a family of winegrowers based in Santenay since the 17th century, decided to strike out on his own, and began producing wine from two hectares of vines that he had inherited from his parents. From his earliest youth Vincent had a passion for working with vines, and great respect for the potential that they represent and was always ambitious to produce his own wine. The quality of his wines was quickly recognized by connoisseurs all over the world, and this enabled him to expand his activity, focusing primarily on the great white and red wines of the Côte de Beaune. In the years between 1980 and 1990 his passion and curiosity led him to try all of the techniques that were being employed at that time. It was only in the early 2000s with the arrival of Eric Germain as winemaker, that a profound change began to take place. They decided to concentrate on the essence of the wines: the expression of the great terroirs of Burgundy. A new purity of style was born, which has now been acknowledged by all winemakers. The Cuvee Saint-Vincent comes mostly from 45 year old vines around the Cote de Beaune. It is aged in 500L barrels (10% new)  for 10 months and blended only on fruit days according to the biodynamic calendar. ",

Other than World War II, when the Germans occupied the country and Chateau de Breze, the Breze family has owned, and continues to own, the chateau. The château is not only a UNESCO World Heritage site, but the wines were regularly exchanged by the royals for Sauternes’ greatest, Château d’Yquem. When the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) of Saumur-Champigny was established in 1957, the owner of Château de Brézé refused the inclusion of his vineyards into this red wine appellation. His claim was that his historical vineyards were the best in the area and that they should have their own AOC, Brézé.  He was denied and the vineyards became part of Saumur. In 2009, the château’s new owner, le Comte de Colbert, asked Yves Lambert and his son, Arnaud to control the winery. They accepted and immediately began converting these historical vineyards to organic after more than fifty years of chemical farming. Today, after many years of quality farming and the deft touch of Arnaud, the brilliance of the wines known centuries ago is reemerging.",

Gérard took over the domaine in 2005; today his daughter Marion also helps out in the cellar and fields. Gérard is modest, almost shy, preferring the majesty of his old-vine Pinot Noir to do the talking. Vinification is traditional and entirely natural; fermentation takes place in vats for approximately 12 days. Then, the wines develop in oak casks for 18 months, 15% of the casks are renewed each year. Bottling is undertaken manually and no filtration is required.  This vineyard borders grand cru Latricières-Chambertin in Gevrey and grand cru Clos de la Roche in Morey-Saint-Denis, sharing similar\nsoils and exposition; in effect, it is surrounded on all sides by grand cru vineyards.

The blazing heat of the sea voyage transformed the flavor of the wines, a metamorphosis reproduced by a process called estufagem during which the wines are heated to as high as 140°F and oxidated. Founded in 1996, Broadbent Madeira was inspired by Bartholomew Broadbent’s father, Michael Broadbent, who called Madeira his “desert island wine,” and who played a crucial role along with his wife, Daphne, in sourcing the wines and establishing the blends. By definition, Malmsey is the sweetest style of Madeira. Composed of Malvasia, from which the very British "Malmsey" nickname is derived. Michael Broadbent, one of the most famous tasters alive today, is responsible for blending this wine, and clearly he is someone who prefers a jolt of acidity in his madeiras, even the typically unctuous, sweet Malmsey.',

The Clapes have been vignerons for many generations, but the infamous grower strikes of 1906 and 1907 forced Auguste's grandfather out of the Languedoc and into the Northern Rhône to start anew from practically nothing. The Clapes rebuilt their fortunes, terrace by terrace, along the steep, western slopes of the Rhône River. For many years, the majority of growers in Cornas sold their fruit to négociants. Auguste was the first to bottle his own wine, which eventually paved the way for such contemporary superstars as Thierry Allemand. Without pretense or fanfare, Auguste, the former mayor of Cornas, was a stately picture of grace and magnanimity—a no-nonsense wise man who never rested on his laurels and sought to better himself and his wines each year until his passing in 2018 at the age of 93. Today, his son, Pierre-Marie, and grandson, Olivier, carry on his legacy with honor and integrity.

Chateau Kirwan was one of the few Medoc properties that Thomas Jefferson, the Ambassador to France and future third President of the United States visited on his Bordeaux wine tasting trip. We know this based on the personal records and diaries of Thomas Jefferson, written in 1780. After a long period when Chateau Kirwan was not known for producing the quality of wine the Left Bank estate was able to produce, the management hired Michel Rolland to consult the estate starting in 1991. Michel Rolland was replaced in 2006 at Chateau Kirwan. Jean Henri Schyler was in charge of managing the chateau until he passed away, November, 2016 at the age of 85.

For 5 generations the family has always waited for “the time it takes” “the right waiting time” and it is this that sets the pace of all the work. “Rocce Rosse” describes the red rocks that dominate this high altitude vineyard and the wine harkens to some of the great, old-school Gran Reserva bottlings of Rioja: Hand-harvested Nebbiolo, typically picked in mid-October, is fermented in 50-hectoliter oak vats known as tini, then aged in similarly large, used oak vats for four years. After the wood aging, Rocce Rosse is then rested in cement vats for a time and then further aged in bottle until Isabella and company deem it ready for release.",

      "Established in 1987, Domaine Drouhin Oregon is owned by the Drouhin Family of Burgundy (Maison Joseph Drouhin). Fourth-generation winemaker Véronique Drouhin-Boss produces wines of distinction, balance, elegance and longevity. Philippe Drouhin, who oversees the family vineyards in Burgundy and Oregon, is responsible for the 225-acre estate. Today, 130 acres are under vine and certified sustainable by L.I.V.E. The family’s principled approach to viticulture and winemaking, and long experience with Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, have earned an international reputation for excellence. The Louise cuvée is always special. In each vintage, Véronique focuses on a few favorite barrels that, once nurtured and artfuly blended, will become Louise. Seamless, complex, layered and deeply pleasing, it is a rare and decidedly wonderful wine. The Pinot Noir is handpicked and hand-sorted, de-stemmed, and then allowed to ferment at its own pace. Typically in barrel for 15 months, Louise maintains its sense of place and vintage character through a gentle élevage, and the use of only 20% new French oak. ",

At the same time, they were also owners of the famed Bordeaux wine property, Petrus! Following the Arnaud’s involvement, from 1900 to 1991, Chateau Clinet hired the managing director Jean Michel Arcaute in the late 1970’s and Chateau Clinet began producing some of the best wine in their history within a few short years. He brought in Michel Rolland as the consultant and they set out to make wine that challenged the best estates of Pomerol. They increased the amount of new, French oak barrels the wine was aging in, as well as increasing the time the wine spent in oak. Chateau Clinet is situated on great terroir. Their vineyards are located at one of the highest points on the Pomerol Plateau. Their closest neighbors are only a stones throw away, Chateau l'Eglise Clinet, Chateau Clos l'Eglise, and Chateau Trotanoy. They also have vines with more gravel close to Lafleur and Petrus.",

      "The story began near the village of Charly-sur-Marne in the Champagne region of France, where a very young Christophe Baron walked the family vineyard with his father and grandfather. He was the youngest of the centuries-old Champagne house. Like generations of fathers and sons before, it was in his blood to be a wine grower and creator—a true vigneron. “It’s a title you're born with, not something you become or learn in school, An unexpected internship at a winery brought Christophe to the Walla Walla Valley for the first time in 1993. After one year, he traveled the world gaining experience in Australia, New Zealand, Romania and Oregon. He intended to buy some land and start a vineyard from scratch, but all those plans came to an abrupt halt on an April morning in 1996. Christophe had returned to Walla Walla for a strictly social visit, and was wandering the countryside with a friend. As they drove near the Oregon/Washington border, he spied an open field littered with acres of softball-sized stones. Plans to move to the Willamette Valley were quickly discarded, and Christophe resolved to buy the property and plant a vineyard. He saw something different with enormous potential. The terroir reminded him of the cobblestones of the southern Rhone valley and Châteuneuf-du-Pape in his native France. “I almost fell on my derrière when I saw those stones,” he says. “And I've been living the dream ever since.” ",

Les Pavots is Peter Michael’s flagship blend of red Bordeaux varietals from our Knights Valley Estate. While the blend varies from vintage to vintage, typically it is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with roughly equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot and a touch of Petit Verdot. Les Pavots captures an elegant refined expression of the terroir embracing the full spectrum of Cabernet family varietal expression with its trademark touch of herbes de provence.

Baron Philippe de Rothschild becomes a minority shareholder in 1933. From 1956 to 1988, the wine was called Mouton Baron Philippe, then Mouton Baronne Philippe. A Fifth Growth of acknowledged quality, its original identity as Château d’Armailhac was fully restored in 1989. 2010 was a dry but relatively cool year, with no summer heatwave. These factors – dry conditions without drought, an exceptional amount of sunshine, cool nights and rainfall that arrived at just the right time – give the 2010 vintage a remarkable identity.

Inspired by the great wines of Burgundy and other top regions (his mentors were Edmond Vatan and Henri Jayer) and emboldened by the wisdom and traditions of his grandfather, Louis Dagueneau, he set about to create a Pouilly-Fumé of extraordinary dimension and terroir focus exploiting the top vineyard sites around St. Andelain. He acquired his first parcel, 1.2 hectares of En Chailloux, and began to vinify under his own label in the 1982 vintage. In 1985, he added the now infamous Silex, and in 1988, Pur Sang.",
